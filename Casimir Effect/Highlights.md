# Highlights

### 1. This paper presents a novel derivation of the Casimir effect formula for the average vacuum energy density between two perfectly conducting plates.
### 2. The derivation achieves the same result as the standard approach using zeta-regularization, but without relying on that specific mathematical technique.
### 3. The paper explores the relationship between the expected vacuum energy and the change in length and position associated with each energy state.
### 4. It calculates the area element connected to each energy state and relates it to the uncertainty principle.

### 5. Overall, this work highlights an alternative approach to deriving the Casimir effect and avoids the use of zeta-regularization.
