\section{Conclusion}

This work calculates the absolute value of the energy density. 
However, since the energy inside the plates is negative, as previously established, 
the expected vacuum energy is also negative.
\begin{align}
    \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = -\frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{720 a^3}
\end{align}

The current work has explored the theoretical implications of negative pressure within the Casimir effect. 
A crucial next step is to definitively address the question of whether negative energy truly exists.
