This paper presents a new way to derive the Casimir force.
Unlike traditional methods, this approach avoids using zeta-regularization to handle infinities. 
This work achieves this by relating the vacuum energy to changes in position and length of energy states, 
incorporating the uncertainty principle. 
The resulting formula matches the standard Casimir effect formula, demonstrating an alternative method for understanding this phenomenon.
